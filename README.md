  <h1>Swisschems Pramipexole (Prami) 1.2 mg Review: My Personal Experience</h1>

  <p>I’ve spent six weeks testing Swisschems’ Pramipexole (Prami) 1.2 mg capsules (60 caps, 0.2 mg each). In this review, I’ll share how I measured recovery, sleep quality, endurance, and strength gains. Everything here comes from my own trials and real user feedback.</p>

  <h2>What Is Pramipexole?</h2>
  <p>Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist that helps regulate neurotransmitters. Athletes use it to support recovery, control prolactin, and optimize sleep. Swisschems’ formula comes in easy-to-swallow capsules, each with 0.2 mg of pramipexole dihydrochloride.</p>

  <h2>How I Tested and Ranked This Product</h2>
  <p>To keep things clear, I ran two separate six-week cycles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Cycle A (Recovery focus):</strong> Low dose (0.2 mg daily), measured sleep quality with a wearable tracker.</li>
    <li><strong>Cycle B (Performance focus):</strong> Moderate dose (0.4 mg split morning/evening), logged gym sessions and perceived exertion.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I tracked:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Sleep latency and duration</li>
    <li>Morning muscle soreness (scale 1–10)</li>
    <li>Workout RPE (rate of perceived exertion)</li>
    <li>Bodyweight and basic lifts (squat, bench, deadlift)</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Faster recovery:</strong> Morning soreness dropped from 6/10 to 3/10 by week 4.</p>
  <p><strong>Endurance boost:</strong> In cycle B, I ran 1 km faster by 10 seconds at the same effort.</p>
